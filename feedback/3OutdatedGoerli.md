## Transition to a New Testnet

Please ensure that you transition to an active and supported testnet. Popular options include:

- **Sepolia:** A preferred testnet for Ethereum with a similar setup to Goerli.

Make sure to update all your configurations to reflect the testnet you're using and replace any outdated references to Goerli in your documentation and codebase.
